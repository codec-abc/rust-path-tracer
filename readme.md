This is a simple path tracer written in rust as an exercise to get familiar with the language.

It should work out of the box by typing

```cargo run```

The code is based on Kevin Beason's path tracer.
[Here](http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt) is the original article with corresponding code (in C++)
